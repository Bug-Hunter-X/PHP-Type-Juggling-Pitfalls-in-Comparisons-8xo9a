In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with type juggling and comparisons, especially when comparing strings with numbers.  Consider this:

```php
$a = "10";
$b = 10;

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal!";
} else {
  echo "Not equal!";
}
```

This code will output "Equal!" because PHP's loose comparison (`==`) performs type juggling before comparison. It converts the string "10" to an integer 10 before the comparison, leading to equality.  However, if you use strict comparison (`===`), the result changes:

```php
$a = "10";
$b = 10;

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Equal!";
} else {
  echo "Not equal!";
}
```

This will output "Not equal!" because strict comparison checks for both value and type equality. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed, especially when dealing with data from external sources or user input.
