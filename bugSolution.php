The solution involves using PHP's strict comparison operator (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`).  Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality. This addresses the unexpected behavior caused by PHP's type juggling.

```php
$a = "10";
$b = 10;

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Equal!";
} else {
  echo "Not equal!";
}
```

This corrected code will output "Not equal!" because the string "10" and the integer 10 are not considered strictly equal in PHP. This clarifies the intended behavior, avoiding potential errors related to type conversions.
